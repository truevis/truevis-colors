# Color Explorer: English, Indonesian, Malay

An interactive multilingual color explorer that lets you play with colors in three languages while pretending to be productive. Because apparently we needed another trilingual color tool.

## What fresh hell is this?

A fully functional color matching application that translates colors between English, Indonesian, and Malay. Features a color wheel for the visually inclined and a massive table for the data nerds.

## The "Features" (if you can call them that)

- **Interactive Color Wheel**: Drag your cursor around like a toddler with finger paints
- **Multilingual Color Names**: Learn how to say "magenta" in three languages nobody asked about
- **Real-time Matching**: Watch colors get matched in RGB space using Euclidean distance (fancy words for "close enough")
- **Adjustable Specificity**: A slider that goes from "exactly this shade" to "eh, close enough"
- **Searchable Database**: 400+ colors, sortable
- **Responsive Design**: Works on your phone, tablet, and whatever other screens you're addicted to

## Technical Details (for the three people who care)

Built with:

- Tailwind CSS (because writing actual CSS is for suckers)
- iro.js color picker (because reinventing the wheel is overrated)
- Pure JavaScript (no frameworks, we're old school like that)
- Client-side everything
- Vibe-coded initially with Gemini 2.5 Flash

## Data Source

Based on the "Daftar Istilah Warna" (1984) https://repositori.kemendikdasmen.go.id/1698/1/Daftar%20Istillah%20Warna%20%28%201984%20%29.pdf because apparently 40-year-old multilingual color lists are still relevant.
